# Run the ASP.NET example application

This repository includes an example application which demonstrates the validation working both client-side and server-side, and localisation using resource files.

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `GovUk.Frontend.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 or better, click on the `GovUk.Frontend.ExampleApp` project, and run it.

By default the example application uses The Pensions Regulator (TPR) branding. To see the GOV.UK branded version set `TPRStyles: false` in `appsettings.json` and re-run the application.
