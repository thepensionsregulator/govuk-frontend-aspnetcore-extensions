# ThePensionsRegulator.GovUk.Frontend.Umbraco

Based on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) and [ThePensionsRegulator.GovUk.Frontend](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ThePensionsRegulator.GovUk.Frontend).

Use GOV.UK Design System components with the block list and block grid editors in Umbraco, with a WYSIWIG backoffice for editors.

Use the Umbraco backoffice to bind components to a property on your view model.

Filter and override block values so that you can, for example, fetch data from a database and insert it into your page or choose which blocks to display at runtime.

See the [documentation on Github](https://github.com/thepensionsregulator/govuk-frontend-aspnetcore-extensions) for further details.
